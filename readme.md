## How it works

All automations are built around Twitter OAuth which gives us higher rate limits and access to private user actions like tweeting and sending DMs.

### BatchJob

The core automation functionality is built around the [BatchJob](./lib/batch-job.js) class.

`BatchJob` ensures that potentially large batches of Twitter API calls are **serializable** and **resumable**.

A `BatchJob` stores all of the state it would need to continue resolving its async batched operation in the event of an error. `BatchJob` instances can serialize this state in order to support exporting them to persistent storage (like a database or JSON file on disk).

Here's an example of batch job:

```js
// fetches the user ids of all of my followers
const job = BatchJobFactory.createBatchJobTwitterGetFollowers({
  params: {
    // assumes that you already have user oauth credentials
    accessToken: twitterAccessToken,
    accessTokenSecret: twitterAccessTokenSecret,

    // only fetch your first 10 followers for testing purposes
    maxLimit: 10,
    count: 10
  }
})

// process as much of this job as possible until it either completes or errors
await job.run()

// job.status: 'active' | 'done' | 'error'
// job.results: string[]
console.log(job.status, job.results)

// store this job to disk
fs.writeFileSync('out.json', job.serialize())

// ...

// read the job from disk and resume processing
const jobData = fs.readFileSync('out.json')
const job = BatchJobFactory.deserialize(jobData)

if (job.status === 'active') {
  await job.run()
}
```

This example also shows how to serialize and resume a job.

### Workflow

Sequences of `BatchJob` instances can be connected together to form a [Workflow](./lib/workflow.js).

Here's an example workflow:

```js
const job = new Workflow({
  params: {
    // assumes that you already have user oauth credentials
    accessToken: twitterAccessToken,
    accessTokenSecret: twitterAccessTokenSecret,
    pipeline: [
      {
        type: 'twitter:get-followers',
        label: 'followers',
        params: {
          // only fetch your first 10 followers for testing purposes
          maxLimit: 10,
          count: 10
        }
      },
      {
        type: 'twitter:lookup-users',
        label: 'users',
        connect: {
          // connect the output of the first job to the `userIds` param for this job
          userIds: 'followers'
        },
        transforms: ['sort-users-by-fuzzy-popularity']
      },
      {
        type: 'twitter:send-direct-messages',
        connect: {
          // connect the output of the second job to the `users` param for this job
          users: 'users'
        },
        params: {
          // handlebars template with access to the current twitter user object
          template: `Hey @{{user.screen_name}}, I'm testing an open source Twitter automation tool and you happen to be my one and only lucky test user.\n\nSorry for the spam. https://github.com/saasify-sh/twitter-flock`
        }
      }
    ]
  }
})

await job.run()
```

This workflow is comprised of three jobs:

- `twitter:get-followers` - Fetches the user ids of all of your followers.
  - Batches twitter API calls to [twitter followers/ids](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/accounts-and-users/follow-search-get-users/api-reference/get-followers-ids)
- `twitter:lookup-users` - Expands these user ids into user objects.
  - Batches twitter API calls to [users/lookup](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/accounts-and-users/follow-search-get-users/api-reference/get-users-lookup)
- `twitter:send-direct-messages` - Sends a template-based direct message to each of these users.
  - Batches twitter API calls to [direct_messages/events/new](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/api-reference/new-event)

## Future work

A more robust, scalable version of this project would use a solution like [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org). [Kafka.js](https://kafka.js.org) looks useful as a higher-level Node.js wrapper.

Kafka would add quite a bit of complexity, but it would also handle a lot of details and be significantly more efficient. In particular, Kafka would solve the producer / consumer model, give us more robust error handling, horizontal scalability, storing and committing state, and enable easy interop with different data sources and sinks.

This project was meant as a quick prototype, however, and our relatively simple `BatchJob` abstraction works pretty well all things considered.

### Producer / Consumer

One of the disadvantages of the current design is that a `BatchJob` needs to complete before any dependent jobs can run, whereas we'd really like to model this as a [Producer-Consumer problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer%E2%80%93consumer_problem).

### DAGs

Another shortcoming of the current design is that `Workflows` can only combine sequences of jobs where the output of one job feeds into the input of the next job.

A more extensible design would allow for workflows comprised of [directed acyclic graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph).
